# Reach the Flag

## About the game
The goal of this game is to reach the target point, which is the cell that contains the flag, and make sure to passage on all the board cells by moving the player within the boundaries of the board.
The player loses if he has no possible moves left.

## 
In this game, I implemented algorithms such as A*, deep first, branch first, and unit cost to compare the difference between them in terms of speed and memory usage.
